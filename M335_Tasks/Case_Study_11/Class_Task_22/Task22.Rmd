[Programming with Big Data in R: Scaling Analytics from One to Thousands of Nodes](http://www.sciencedirect.com.byui.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S221457961630065X?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor=&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&ccp=y)

This article talks about how we can use big data and manage it in R. This article actually presents a tutorial on how to do this. It explains different packages in R that help with the development of data analysis algorithms. This article also gives us R code that helps with the analysis of big data and it gives examples and graphics. This article also helps us to speed up computations in R.
